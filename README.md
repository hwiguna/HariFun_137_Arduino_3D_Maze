# HariFun_137_Arduino_3D_Maze
This is probably not the best way to map 3D Maze onto 2D LCD screen, but I sure had fun challenging myself to do this without any 3D libraries, without any matrix operations, and no trigonometric functions at all.  Everything you see on the LCD screen is computed with nothing more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  All lines are drawn using u8glib.drawLine().

Cheers,
